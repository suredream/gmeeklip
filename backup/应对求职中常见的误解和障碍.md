应对求职中常见的误解和障碍
You’ve probably heard some of the stories before. You might be so convinced that these stories – myths – are true, that they’re keeping you from even starting your job search. You know the ones:
你可能之前听过一些这样的故事。你可能坚信这些故事——所谓的“迷思”——是真的，以至于它们甚至让你不敢开始找工作。你知道这些故事：

I can't get a job because I don’t have a job.
我找不到工作，因为我没有工作。
I’m too old (or young) to get hired.
我太老了（或太年轻了），无法被雇用。
I can’t get hired at that company because they just downsized.
我无法被那家公司录用，因为他们刚刚裁员。
I have no experience in that industry – I can’t get hired there.
我没有该行业的经验——我无法在那里找到工作。
There are no jobs in the summer or over the holidays.
暑假和假期期间没有工作。
Dispelling these myths is an important part of moving forward. They are nothing more than self-defeating barriers that will hinder your search and stifle your confidence.
消除这些误解是前进的重要一环。它们不过是自我挫败的障碍，会阻碍你的探索，扼杀你的信心。

Don’t Believe Everything You Hear
不要相信你听到的一切
When job searching, some people might use myths as a “crutch,” or excuse for not putting their full effort into finding a new job. If you’re serious about finding a job, don’t believe everything you hear. They are called myths for a reason.
找工作时，有些人可能会把一些流言蜚语当作“拐杖”，或者当作不全力以赴找新工作的借口。如果你真的想找工作，就不要轻信所有听到的谣言。它们之所以被称为流言蜚语，是有原因的。

I can’t get a job if I don’t have one. This is a common misconception. It’s simply not true that if you’re currently out of work you won’t get hired. LHH candidates dispel this belief all the time as they see those around them getting prospects and jobs – and then they confidently go forth and land one themselves.
如果没有工作，我就找不到工作。这是一个常见的误解。“如果你现在失业了，就找不到工作”这种想法根本不对。LHH 的求职者总是能打破这种想法，因为他们看到周围的人都有了工作机会，然后他们也会自信地去争取，最终自己也找到了工作。
I’m too old (or young) to get hired. There are three components of age – chronological age, skillset, and the impression you make. If your skillset is up to date in your field and you appear enthusiastic, age won’t matter.
我太老了（或者太年轻了），无法被录用。年龄由三个因素决定：实际年龄、技能以及你给人的印象。如果你的技能在你的领域是最新的，并且你看起来充满热情，那么年龄就不是问题。
I can’t get hired at that company because they just downsized. Companies adjust their staffing as business conditions change. Sometimes there is a need for new employees in one department, while changing conditions require cutbacks in another department. If both departments use the same skillsets, people can be moved from one area to another. But if different skills are required, the company will hire in one area while doing a layoff in another.
我没能在那家公司找到工作，因为他们刚刚裁员。公司会根据业务情况的变化调整人员配置。有时一个部门需要新员工，而另一个部门则因为情况变化而需要裁员。如果两个部门需要相同的技能，人员可以从一个部门调到另一个部门。但如果需要不同的技能，公司就会在一个部门招聘，而在另一个部门裁员。
I have no experience in that industry – I can’t get hired there. This is not always true. Sometimes less-qualified candidates get hired because of their “fit” with a company. In addition to your specific background, you’re selling enthusiasm, intelligence, motivation, and interest in them.
我没有这个行业的经验——我肯定找不到工作。这并非总是如此。有时，资历较浅的求职者会因为“适合”这家公司而获得录用。除了你具体的背景之外，你还要展现出热情、智慧、动力以及对他们的兴趣。
There are no jobs in the summer or over the holidays. Schools may take a break during the summer, but employers certainly don’t. When hiring slows down during holiday periods there are always great opportunities to network and position yourself for the jobs that open-up after the holiday. Don’t pay attention to those who say, “There are no jobs out there – especially now,” or “Everyone is away for the summer.”
暑假和假期期间没有工作机会。学校暑假可能会放假，但雇主肯定不会。假期期间招聘放缓，总有很好的机会拓展人脉，争取假期后出现的空缺职位。不要理会那些说“现在没有工作机会了——尤其是现在”或“大家都在暑假”的人。
The Internet Trap  互联网陷阱
Taking your job search online is a necessary part of the process. Creating and developing your network on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, finding up-to-date information on prospective companies and competitive salaries, and staying current on industry trends are all great ways to leverage the internet.
在线求职是求职过程中必不可少的一部分。在领英、Facebook 和 Twitter 上建立和发展你的人脉网络，查找潜在公司和有竞争力的薪资的最新信息，并随时关注行业趋势，这些都是利用互联网的好方法。

But having technology at your fingertips can also be a major time drain. You might think you’re doing the right thing by doing a deep dive on job sites like Monster, Indeed, Dice, CareerBuilder and so many others like them. And they are a good thing, to an extent. Except when a quick search leads you to an article, leads you to another, unrelated site, and then an hour is gone and nothing has been accomplished. The key is to not let them monopolize your time, which can lead to intense frustration.
但随手可得的科技也可能浪费大量时间。你可能认为深入研究 Monster、Indeed、Dice、CareerBuilder 等众多类似的求职网站是正确的做法。从某种程度上来说，它们也是一件好事。但有时，快速搜索会带你找到一篇文章，然后又带你进入另一个不相关的网站，结果一个小时过去了，你却一无所获。关键在于不要让这些网站占用你的时间，否则你可能会感到非常沮丧。

Consider the fact that this these are public postings, which means you and thousands of others are responding to the same job. Unless you have a direct connection with a hiring manager or have a contact inside the company that can help you, your chances of getting an interview or offer are slim.
考虑到这些都是公开招聘信息，这意味着你和成千上万的人都在应聘同一份职位。除非你直接联系招聘经理，或者公司内部有可以帮你的人脉，否则你获得面试或录用的机会很小。

Our advice here is simple: Use the Internet but don't let it use you. Diversify your search so that the Internet is just one facet of your job hunt.
我们的建议很简单：利用互联网，但不要让它利用你。多元化你的搜索方式，让互联网成为你求职过程中的一个环节。

At LHH, our recruiters have a rule when they're conducting an Internet search: Know what information you want before you go online. If you haven’t found it in 10 minutes, stop and get advice on where to find it. Even if you are finding useful information, stop and evaluate it after 10 minutes. What is its value to you? How do you plan to use it? This is a smart way to avoid information overload or that sickening feeling you get from surfing from one site to another.
在 LHH，我们的招聘人员在进行互联网搜索时有一条规则：上网前先了解自己需要什么信息。如果十分钟内找不到，请停下来咨询如何获取。即使找到了有用的信息，十分钟后也要停下来评估一下。这些信息对你有什么价值？你打算如何使用它？这是一个避免信息过载或从一个网站跳转到另一个网站时产生的那种恶心感的聪明方法。

The Time Warp  时间扭曲
Why is everything moving so slowly? The feeling is real. When you were working, a week or two would whiz by, and you’d wonder where the time went. Now that you're in transition, waiting for people to respond to your resume, answer your calls, or invite you in for an interview, time drags – a day can seem like an eternity! Remember, you're on the slow side of the time warp.
为什么一切都进展得这么慢？这种感觉很真实。你工作的时候，一两周就过去了，你甚至会怀疑时间都去哪儿了。现在你正处于过渡期，等待着别人回复你的简历、接你的电话，或者邀请你去面试，时间过得真慢——一天都感觉像永恒！记住，你正处于时间扭曲的缓慢一侧。

You may be saying to yourself, "The recruiter said I’d hear this week! What's wrong with these people?" Recruiters, hiring managers, HR departments, and even your friends may promise one thing and do another. Why? Because despite how important hiring is, other things take priority. Let's say a company tells you that they're going to be interviewing in the next week or two and then you don't hear from them. Politely follow up and you may discover that the schedule slipped because someone had to go out of town, or there was a critical sales meeting or some other obligation. If you don’t hear back immediately, don’t panic or take it personally. There could be a very legitimate reason for the delay.
你可能会心想：“招聘人员说这周就能通知我！这些人怎么了？”招聘人员、招聘经理、人力资源部门，甚至你的朋友，都可能言行不一。为什么？因为尽管招聘很重要，但其他事情比招聘更重要。假设一家公司告诉你他们将在未来一两周内进行面试，但你却迟迟没有收到他们的回复。礼貌地跟进一下，你可能会发现面试时间被推迟了，因为有人必须出差，或者有一场重要的销售会议或其他安排。如果你没有立即收到回复，不要惊慌，也不要介意。延迟可能有非常正当的理由。

One of the biggest adjustments after a job loss is dealing with a loss of structure. Without having to be anywhere or do anything, it's hard to be productive. Focus on your Marketing Plan for your search and proactively implement it, and you'll find that time will become a bit less frustrating. And by keeping your pipeline full, you'll begin to see results.
失业后最大的调整之一就是应对失去秩序。如果无法去任何地方或做任何事情，很难保持高效。专注于你的求职营销计划并积极实施，你会发现时间会变得不那么令人沮丧。保持你的渠道畅通，你就会开始看到成果。

The Emotional Roller Coaster
情绪过山车
You may end up being second in the selection process, maybe more than once. That is normal! It would be great to be hired for the one and only job you apply to, with all the bells and whistles, but know that it may not happen that way. Don't dwell on it, learn from it, and move on. You should always have three opportunities in your pipeline until you have a final offer in front of you. Remember: a promise of an offer is not an offer!
你可能最终在筛选过程中排名第二，甚至不止一次。这很正常！如果能被录用，获得你申请的唯一一份工作，享受所有福利待遇，那当然很棒，但要知道，事情可能并非如此。不要纠结于此，吸取教训，继续前进。在拿到最终的录用通知之前，你应该始终保留三个机会。记住：承诺录用可不是真正的录用通知！

Stay the Course  坚持到底
Don’t let the myths you’ve heard time and time again stop you from getting started, keep focused on the matter at hand, and do not get discouraged. The hiring process takes time, and it’s important to spend that time productively and with confidence. Keep your pipeline full and the prospects will follow!
不要让那些你一次又一次听到的谬论阻碍你开始，专注于眼前的事情，不要灰心丧气。招聘过程需要时间，重要的是要高效且自信地利用这段时间。保持你的人才库充足，潜在客户自然会来！
