How will the internet evolve in the coming decades?  
未来几十年互联网将会如何发展？

Fiction writers have explored some possibilities.  
小说作家已经探索了一些可能性。

In his 2019 novel “[Fall](https://www.nealstephenson.com/fall,-or-dodge-in-hell.html),” science fiction author [Neal Stephenson](https://www.librarything.com/author/stephensonneal) imagined a near future in which the internet still exists. But it has become so polluted with misinformation, disinformation and advertising that it is largely unusable.  
科幻小说作家[尼尔·斯蒂芬森 (Neal Stephenson](https://www.librarything.com/author/stephensonneal) ) 在其 2019 年的小说《[坠落](https://www.nealstephenson.com/fall,-or-dodge-in-hell.html)》中设想了不久的将来互联网仍然存在的情景。但互联网已经被错误信息、虚假信息和广告污染，以至于基本上无法使用。

Characters in Stephenson’s novel deal with this problem by subscribing to “edit streams” – human-selected news and information that can be considered trustworthy.  
斯蒂芬森小说中的人物通过订阅“编辑流”来解决这个问题——订阅人类选择的、可以被认为是可信的新闻和信息。

The drawback is that only the wealthy can afford such bespoke services, leaving most of humanity to consume low-quality, noncurated online content.  
缺点是只有富人才能负担得起这种定制服务，而大多数人只能消费低质量、未经整理的在线内容。

To some extent, this has already happened: Many news organizations, such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, have placed their curated content behind paywalls. Meanwhile, [misinformation festers](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/technology/misinformation-integrity-institute-report.html) on social media platforms like X and TikTok.  
某种程度上，这种情况已经发生了：许多新闻机构，例如《纽约时报》和《华尔街日报》，都已将其精选内容置于付费墙内。与此同时，[虚假信息在 X 和 TikTok 等社交媒体平台上泛滥成灾](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/technology/misinformation-integrity-institute-report.html)。

Stephenson’s record as a prognosticator has been impressive – he [anticipated the metaverse](https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-metaverse-2-media-and-information-experts-explain-165731) in his 1992 novel “[Snow Crash](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172832/snow-crash-by-neal-stephenson/),” and a key plot element of his “[Diamond Age](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172835/the-diamond-age-by-neal-stephenson/),” released in 1995, is an interactive primer that functions [much like a chatbot](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/chatbots-ai-neal-stephenson-diamond-age/677364/).  
斯蒂芬森作为预言家的记录令人印象深刻 - 他在 1992 年的小说“[雪崩](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172832/snow-crash-by-neal-stephenson/)”中[预言了元宇宙](https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-metaverse-2-media-and-information-experts-explain-165731)，而他 1995 年发布的“[钻石时代](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172835/the-diamond-age-by-neal-stephenson/)”的一个关键情节元素是一个功能[类似于聊天机器人的](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/chatbots-ai-neal-stephenson-diamond-age/677364/)交互式入门书。

On the surface, chatbots seem to provide a solution to the misinformation epidemic. By dispensing factual content, chatbots could supply alternative sources of high-quality information that aren’t cordoned off by paywalls.  
从表面上看，聊天机器人似乎为虚假信息泛滥提供了解决方案。通过分发事实内容，聊天机器人可以提供不会被付费墙封锁的替代高质量信息来源。

Ironically, however, the output of these chatbots may represent the greatest danger to the future of the web – one that was hinted at decades earlier by Argentine writer [Jorge Luis Borges](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/obituaries/jorge-luis-borges-a-master-of-fantasy-and-fable-is-dead.html).  
然而讽刺的是，这些聊天机器人的输出可能代表着对网络未来的最大危险——这一点阿根廷作家[豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/obituaries/jorge-luis-borges-a-master-of-fantasy-and-fable-is-dead.html)几十年前就暗示过。

## The rise of the chatbots

聊天机器人的兴起

Today, a significant fraction of the internet still consists of factual and ostensibly truthful content, such as articles and books that have been peer-reviewed, fact-checked or vetted in some way.  
如今，互联网上很大一部分内容仍然包含事实和表面上真实的内容，例如经过同行评审、事实核查或某种方式审查的文章和书籍。

The developers of large language models, or LLMs – the engines that power bots like ChatGPT, Copilot and Gemini – have taken advantage of this resource.  
大型语言模型（即为 ChatGPT、Copilot 和 Gemini 等机器人提供动力的引擎）的开发者已经利用了这一资源。

To perform their magic, however, these models must ingest [immense quantities](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-origins-evolution/behind-chatgpts-wisdom-300-bn-words-570-gb-data/) of high-quality text for training purposes. A vast amount of verbiage has already been scraped from online sources and fed to the fledgling LLMs.  
然而，要发挥其魔力，这些模型必须摄取[大量](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-origins-evolution/behind-chatgpts-wisdom-300-bn-words-570-gb-data/)高质量文本用于训练。大量的措辞已经从在线资源中爬取并输入到刚刚起步的LLMs中。

The problem is that the web, enormous as it is, is a finite resource. High-quality text that hasn’t already been strip-mined is [becoming scarce](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/), leading to what The New York Times called an “[emerging crisis in content](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/ai-data-restrictions.html).”  
问题在于，网络虽然庞大，但资源却是有限的。尚未被挖掘殆尽的优质文本正[变得稀缺](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/)，导致《纽约时报》称之为“[内容危机](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/ai-data-restrictions.html)”。

This has forced companies like OpenAI to [enter into agreements](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/29/atlantic-vox-media-openai-licensing-deal) with publishers to obtain even more raw material for their ravenous bots. But according to one prediction, a shortage of additional high-quality training data may strike [as early as 2026](https://theconversation.com/researchers-warn-we-could-run-out-of-data-to-train-ai-by-2026-what-then-216741).  
这迫使 OpenAI 等公司与出版商[达成协议](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/29/atlantic-vox-media-openai-licensing-deal)，以便为其贪婪的机器人获取更多原始材料。但根据一项预测，额外高质量训练数据的短缺可能[最早在 2026 年就会](https://theconversation.com/researchers-warn-we-could-run-out-of-data-to-train-ai-by-2026-what-then-216741)出现。

As the output of chatbots ends up online, these second-generation texts – complete with made-up information called “[hallucinations](https://medium.com/analytics-matters/generative-ai-its-all-a-hallucination-6b8798445044),” as well as outright errors, such as suggestions to [put glue on your pizza](https://theconversation.com/eat-a-rock-a-day-put-glue-on-your-pizza-how-googles-ai-is-losing-touch-with-reality-230953) – will further pollute the web.  
随着聊天机器人的输出最终出现在网络上，这些第二代文本——充满了被称为“[幻觉](https://medium.com/analytics-matters/generative-ai-its-all-a-hallucination-6b8798445044)”的虚构信息，甚至还有一些彻头彻尾的错误，比如建议[在披萨上涂胶水](https://theconversation.com/eat-a-rock-a-day-put-glue-on-your-pizza-how-googles-ai-is-losing-touch-with-reality-230953)——将进一步污染网络。

And if a chatbot hangs out with the wrong sort of people online, it can pick up their repellent views. Microsoft discovered this the hard way in 2016, when [it had to pull the plug on Tay](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/25/learning-tays-introduction/), a bot that started repeating [racist and sexist content](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/technology/microsoft-created-a-twitter-bot-to-learn-from-users-it-quickly-became-a-racist-jerk.html).  
如果聊天机器人在网上与不良分子混在一起，它就会吸收他们令人反感的观点。微软在 2016 年就深刻体会到了这一点，当时[它不得不停止使用 Tay](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/25/learning-tays-introduction/) ，这个机器人开始重复[种族主义和性别歧视的内容](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/technology/microsoft-created-a-twitter-bot-to-learn-from-users-it-quickly-became-a-racist-jerk.html)。

Over time, all of these issues could make online content even [less trustworthy](https://www.fastcompany.com/91220148/marketers-in-a-dying-internet-why-the-only-option-is-a-return-to-simplicity) and less useful than it is today. In addition, LLMs that are fed a diet of low-calorie content may produce even more problematic output that also ends up on the web.  
随着时间的推移，所有这些问题都可能使在线内容变得比现在更加[不可信](https://www.fastcompany.com/91220148/marketers-in-a-dying-internet-why-the-only-option-is-a-return-to-simplicity)、更无用。此外，以低热量内容为食的人可能会产生更多有问题的输出，而这些输出最终也会出现在网络上。

## An infinite − and useless − library

无限而无用的图书馆

It’s not hard to imagine a feedback loop that results in a continuous process of degradation as the bots feed on their own imperfect output.  
不难想象，当机器人以其自身不完美的输出为食时，反馈循环会导致持续的退化过程。

[A July 2024 paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07566-y) published in Nature explored the consequences of training AI models on recursively generated data. It showed that “irreversible defects” can lead to “[model collapse](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ShjMHfmPs0)” for systems trained in this way – much like an image’s copy and a copy of that copy, and a copy of that copy, will lose fidelity to the original image.  
[2024 年 7 月发表在《自然》杂志上的一篇论文](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07566-y)探讨了在递归生成的数据上训练人工智能模型的后果。论文表明，“不可逆缺陷”可能导致以这种方式训练的系统“[模型崩溃](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ShjMHfmPs0)”——就像一张图像的副本和该副本的副本，以及该副本的副本，都会失去对原始图像的保真度。

How bad might this get?  
情况会变得多糟糕？

Consider Borges’ 1941 short story “[The Library of Babel](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf).” Fifty years before computer scientist [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tim-Berners-Lee) created the architecture for the web, Borges had already imagined an analog equivalent.  
想想博尔赫斯 1941 年的短篇小说“[巴别图书馆](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf)”。在计算机科学家[蒂姆·伯纳斯-李](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tim-Berners-Lee)创建网络架构的五十年前，博尔赫斯就已经想象出一个模拟的等价物。

In his 3,000-word story, the writer imagines a world consisting of an enormous and possibly infinite number of hexagonal rooms. The bookshelves in each room hold uniform volumes that must, its inhabitants intuit, contain every possible permutation of letters in their alphabet.  
在这本 3000 字的小说中，作者想象了一个由无数个六边形房间组成的世界。每个房间的书架上都摆放着统一的书卷，里面的居民直觉地知道，这些书卷里一定包含了字母表中所有可能的字母排列。

![Illustration of connected gold hexagons that expand endlessly into the horizon](https://images.theconversation.com/files/631801/original/file-20241113-17-oasuap.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip)

In Borges’ imaginary, endlessly expansive library of content, finding something meaningful is like finding a needle in a haystack.

在博尔赫斯想象中无限广阔的内容库中，寻找有意义的东西就像大海捞针。aire [images/Moment via Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/group-of-repeating-hexagonal-figures-in-a-3d-royalty-free-image/2171625976?phrase=hexagon%20pattern%20books&searchscope=image%2Cfilm&adppopup=true)

Initially, this realization sparks joy: By definition, there must exist books that detail the future of humanity and the meaning of life.  
最初，这种认识令人欣喜：按照定义，一定存在详细描述人类未来和生命意义的书籍。

The inhabitants search for such books, only to discover that the vast majority contain nothing but meaningless combinations of letters. The truth is out there –but so is every conceivable falsehood. And all of it is embedded in an inconceivably vast amount of gibberish.  
居民们寻找这样的书籍，却发现绝大多数书籍都只是一些毫无意义的字母组合。真相就在那里——但所有可以想象的谎言也在那里。所有这些都隐藏在大量难以想象的胡言乱语中。

Even after centuries of searching, only a few meaningful fragments are found. And even then, there is no way to determine whether these coherent texts are truths or lies. Hope turns into despair.  
即使经过几个世纪的搜寻，也只找到了一些有意义的碎片。即便如此，我们也无法确定这些连贯的文本是真相还是谎言。希望变成了绝望。

Will the web become so polluted that only the wealthy can afford accurate and reliable information? Or will an infinite number of chatbots produce so much tainted verbiage that finding accurate information online becomes like searching for a needle in a haystack?  
网络是否会变得如此污染，以至于只有富人才能负担得起准确可靠的信息？还是无数的聊天机器人会产生如此多的污染言论，以至于在网上寻找准确的信息就像大海捞针？

The internet is often described as one of humanity’s great achievements. But like any other resource, it’s important to give serious thought to how it is maintained and managed – lest we end up confronting the dystopian vision imagined by Borges.  
互联网经常被描述为人类最伟大的成就之一。但与任何其他资源一样，我们必须认真思考如何维护和管理互联网，否则我们最终会面临博尔赫斯想象中的反乌托邦景象。
