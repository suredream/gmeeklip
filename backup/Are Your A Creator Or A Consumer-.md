I'm an information addict.
我是一个信息上瘾者。

I have a regular pattern I follow every few months. I want to learn a new skill or a new hobby, so I instantly head over to Amazon and buy 3-4 books on that topic. On my bookcase right now, I have books on the basics of HTML, card magic, golf, screenwriting, motor racing, meditation, weightlifting, and about 10 other topics.
我每隔几个月就会遵循一个固定的模式。我想学习一项新技能或一个新的爱好，所以我会立即去亚马逊买 3-4 本关于这个主题的书。现在我的书架上摆满了 HTML 基础知识、纸牌魔术、高尔夫、编剧、赛车、冥想、举重以及大约 10 个其他主题的书。

I usually subscribe to a bunch of blogs and podcasts too. I read all the most popular posts, and listen to the best expert interviews. If I'm felling really productive I might even make some notes in Evernote, or bookmark some pages in Delicious.
我通常也会订阅一些博客和播客。我会阅读所有最受欢迎的帖子，并聆听最精彩的专家访谈。如果感觉自己效率很高，我甚至会在 Evernote 上做笔记，或者在 Delicious 上收藏一些页面。

And yet, there's always one thing missing: actual output.
然而，总是缺少一件事： 实际产出。

‍I've coded very few websites. I know maybe 3 card tricks. I've never written a screenplay or competed in a real car race. I don't know the exact number of times I've ever meditated, but it's definitely less than 50.
我写过很少的网站代码。我大概会 3 个纸牌魔术。我从未写过剧本，也从未参加过真正的赛车比赛。我不知道自己冥想的具体次数，但肯定少于 50 次。

Finding and consuming information is easy. It's interesting. And for someone as curious as me, it's usually pretty exciting too.
查找和使用信息很容易。这很有趣。对于像我这样好奇的人来说，这通常也很令人兴奋。

But it doesn't actually accomplish anything. It's pseudo-work. Intellectual masturbation.
但实际上它什么也没做成。这只是伪工作，智力上的自慰。

It's much more effective to create. To get stuck in and start making things -- websites, golf shots, screenplays, whatever -- and then one of two things will happen. You either realise that you're not that interested in it, or you love it, and go really deep on it. That's worth doing. Mindlessly consuming surface-level information is not.
创造更有效率。全身心投入，开始创作——网站、高尔夫球、剧本等等——然后会发生两种情况之一。你要么意识到自己对它并不那么感兴趣，要么热爱它，并深入研究它。这值得一试。而盲目地获取表面信息则不值得。

Which one are you doing?
你在做哪一个？
