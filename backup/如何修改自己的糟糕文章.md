How To Edit Your Own Lousy Writing
如何修改自己的糟糕文章
Julian Gough Oct 24, 2017 Essay
朱利安·高夫2017 年 10 月 24 日散文

If…  如果…
You don’t write as well as you would like to;
你的写作水平不如自己想象的那么好；
And you keep trying to improve by writing more first drafts, each time hoping they’ll be better;
你不断尝试通过撰写更多初稿来改进，每次都希望它们会更好；
And they mysteriously don’t get much better;
但奇怪的是，他们的状况并没有好转；
… that’s because you’ve misunderstood the problem.
……那是因为你误解了这个问题。

You don’t need to learn how to write, you need to learn how to edit. But then, editing is writing; writing is editing. The separation of the two is FAKE NEWS.
你不需要学习如何写作，你需要学习如何编辑。但是，编辑就是写作；写作就是编辑。将两者分开是假新闻。

Editing is the second (the hidden, unglamorous, yet vital) half of writing, just as digestion is the hidden, unglamorous, yet vital second half of eating. (Which would make reading… hmmm… Let’s stop that metaphor right there…)
编辑是写作的后半部分（隐蔽、平淡无奇但至关重要），就像消化是进食的后半部分（隐蔽、平淡无奇但至关重要）。（这会让阅读……嗯……我们就此打住这个比喻吧……）

When writers talk of ‘learning to write’, they mostly mean how they slowly learned to edit their own lousy first drafts.
当作家谈到“学习写作”时，他们大多指的是如何慢慢学会编辑自己糟糕的初稿。

So this is a guide to that.
这就是对此的一个指南。

(An aside: all first drafts are lousy just as all newborn babies are terrible at sports. Writing takes time and multiple drafts. You’re not doing it wrong.)
（题外话：所有的初稿都很糟糕，就像所有的新生儿都不擅长运动一样。写作需要时间和多次修改。你没有做错。）

 

IF YOU WROTE IT, WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET
如果你写了它，你所看到的并不是你得到的

And the key to editing your own work? Learn to read it like a reader. Like a first time reader. Someone who has never seen this piece of work before. Someone who isn’t you…
编辑自己作品的关键是什么？学会像读者一样阅读。像初次阅读的人一样。像从未见过这部作品的人一样。像不是你的人一样……

This is way harder than you’d think. When writers reread their own work, there is a tendency to see the story not as it actually is on the page but as it is in their head. That is the inexperienced writer uses the words on the page as triggers, as reminders, of the original vision in their head.
这比你想象的要难得多。当作家重读自己的作品时，他们往往不按纸上实际的样子看待故事，而是按脑子里的样子看待故事。也就是说，缺乏经验的作家会用纸上的文字作为触发因素，作为提醒，提醒他们脑子里最初的设想。

 

GETTING HIGH ON YOUR OWN SUPPLY
靠自己的供应获得快感

So a writer might, for instance, have a specific house they remember from their youth that triggers specific memories for that writer. To capture this, they might write: ‘She stared at the old house. Her head filled with memories…’ Later, going back to edit this, they reread their own words: ‘She stared at the old house.’ Ah, yes! The words trigger the impulse that led to the words. They can see the specific house they have in mind; they see the dark green ivy covering a high window entirely, so the house looks one-eyed and piratical, they see the saplings and small bushes sprouting in the long-blocked, leaf-filled gutters, they see the ancient elm in the garden, leaning against the side of the house as though drunk. ‘Her head filled with memories…’ They read that, and, oh yes, they remember the first time they kissed someone they loved, in the shed out the back, and how amazing it felt. The sharp smell of cut grass and petrol rising from the still-warm lawnmower… They are having a marvellous time when they reread their draft.
例如，一位作家可能记得自己年轻时住过一所特定的房子，而这所房子会勾起他特定的回忆。为了捕捉这一点，他们可能会这样写：“她凝视着那座老房子。她的脑海里充满了回忆……”后来，他们回过头来编辑这句话，重读自己的话：“她凝视着那座老房子。”啊，是的！这些词触发了写出这些词的冲动。他们可以看到他们脑海中那座特定的房子；他们看到深绿色的常春藤完全覆盖了一扇高高的窗户，所以房子看起来像独眼的海盗，他们看到树苗和小灌木丛在长期堵塞、长满树叶的排水沟里发芽，他们看到花园里那棵古老的榆树，像喝醉了一样靠在房子的一侧。“她的脑海里充满了回忆……”他们读到这句话，哦，是的，他们记得第一次亲吻他们爱的人，在后面的棚子里，那种感觉是多么美妙。从尚在热气的割草机里飘出刺鼻的草味和汽油味……当他们重新阅读草稿时，他们玩得很开心。

But a reader who isn’t the writer just has the words provided on the page to go on: ‘She stared at the old house. Her head filled with memories…’ The reader has to fill in all the details. With nothing else to go on, they will tend to see a generic, rather featureless house. They might not give the house a garden at all. They will assign some vague and nonspecific memories. No colours, smells or sounds.
但对于非作者的读者来说，他们只能根据页面上提供的文字继续读下去：“她凝视着这座老房子。她的脑海里充满了回忆……”读者必须填写所有细节。如果没有其他线索，他们往往会看到一座普通的、毫无特色的房子。他们可能根本不会给这座房子配上花园。他们会分配一些模糊而不具体的记忆。没有颜色、气味或声音。

What has happened in the reader’s head is nothing like as good as what has happened in the writer’s head. The writer’s vision was not transmitted to the reader by the marks on paper. The telepathy which is at the heart of writing has failed to occur. But the inexperienced writer is often oblivious to this failure.
读者头脑中发生的事情与作家头脑中发生的事情完全不同。作家的设想并没有通过纸上的标记传达给读者。写作的核心——心灵感应未能发生。但没有经验的作家往往对这一失败视而不见。

 

HOW DARE THEY REJECT MY GENIUS!
他们怎么敢拒绝我的天才！

This is one reason why so many writers, starting out, are wounded and hurt by criticism, by rejection. They can’t understand how anyone could reject the amazing story that is in their head. They are unaware that what they have actually put down on the page isn’t the amazing story in their head—it’s a groping towards that story, a blueprint, a very rough sketch or outline of that story.
这就是为什么许多刚开始写作的作家会因为批评和拒绝而受到伤害的原因之一。他们无法理解为什么有人会拒绝他们脑海中的精彩故事。他们没有意识到，他们写在纸上的并不是他们脑海中的精彩故事——而是对这个故事的摸索、蓝图、非常粗略的草图或大纲。

And this is natural and normal, this is OK, this is an early draft, this is fine, this is what most of us do when we write. But the process of becoming a writer is the process of learning how to convert the amazing story in your head into marks on a page that are capable of triggering something very like your original story in the reader’s head—the reader who isn’t you.
这是自然而正常的，这是可以的，这是初稿，这很好，这是我们大多数人写作时所做的。但成为一名作家的过程是学习如何将你头脑中精彩的故事转化为纸上的标记的过程，这些标记能够在读者的头脑中触发与你原始故事非常相似的东西——读者不是你。

And so most writing isn’t first-draft writing. It’s rewriting, again and again, trying to bring the story into focus. To show, not tell. To get the reader closer to the action, to the living moment. Your job is to make something interesting happen in a stranger’s head.
所以大多数写作都不是初稿。而是一遍又一遍地重写，试图让故事更加清晰。展示，而不是讲述。让读者更接近情节，更接近生动的瞬间。你的工作是让陌生人的脑海中发生一些有趣的事情。

This is hard, but it’s not impossible.
这很难，但并非不可能。

 

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
你到底在干什么？

Normally, when we read, we are unaware that we are reading. We don’t consciously notice the astonishing thing we are doing: recognising, one by one, black marks arranged in lines on a page or screen, and converting them (in a complex process of memory-triggering and invention) into a coherent, flowing stream of internal mental pictures.
通常情况下，当我们阅读时，我们意识不到自己正在阅读。我们并没有意识到自己正在做一件令人惊奇的事情：逐一识别出页面上或屏幕上排列成行的黑色标记，并将它们（在触发记忆和创造的复杂过程中）转换成连贯流畅的内部心理图像流。

 

READING IN SLOW MOTION  慢动作阅读

A great way to see your own work afresh (to read it like a reader) is to deliberately reread your own stuff in slow motion; intensely aware of the order in which the words arrive, and of what they are making happen in your head. This isn’t, quite, reading – it’s paying attention to yourself reading. It’s watching yourself read. In doing this, you will be much better able to see those moments where the words fail to deliver the necessary information in the right order, and thus cause a break in the flow of internal mental pictures.
重新审视自己作品（像读者一样阅读）的一个好方法是故意慢动作重读自己的作品；强烈意识到单词出现的顺序，以及它们在你脑海中产生的影响。这不完全是阅读——而是关注你自己的阅读。这是看着自己阅读。通过这样做，你将能够更好地看到那些单词未能以正确的顺序传递必要信息的时刻，从而导致内部心理图像的流动中断。

 

ORDER OF INFORMATION  信息顺序

I am OBSESSED with the order in which information is released in a story. You need to release the information to the reader in the order the reader needs it, so they can see the scene. That is often not the order it occurred to you while writing the first draft.
我对故事中信息发布的顺序非常着迷。你需要按照读者需要的顺序向读者发布信息，这样他们才能看到场景。这通常不是你在写初稿时想到的顺序。

That means, for example, if you walk your character through a door in a new location at the start of a chapter, don’t have loads of exciting stuff happen to the character before telling the reader what kind of room they are in. The reader may well have imagined they are in a kitchen, or a warehouse, long before you tell them it is in fact a submarine, or the Sistine Chapel, and they will resent you for putting them in the wrong.
举例来说，如果你在章节开始时带领角色穿过一个新地点的门，那么在告诉读者他们身处什么样的房间之前，不要让角色经历太多令人兴奋的事情。在你告诉读者这实际上是一艘潜艇或西斯廷教堂之前，读者很可能已经想象他们是在厨房或仓库里，他们会怨恨你把他们放在了错误的位置。

If your point-of-view character (the reader’s stand-in) walks into a small room with a dead bear in it, don’t be all cutesy and not tell us about the bear until we’re two pages in. Unless there’s a good reason not to, tell the reader what the point-of-view character would be struck by, as they’re struck by it.
如果您的视角人物（读者的替身）走进一间有一只死熊的小房间，请不要装可爱，直到我们读到两页才告诉我们有关这只熊的情况。除非有充分的理由不这样做，否则在读者被震撼时，告诉视角人物会被什么震撼。

This applies to everything. Remember, the reader can’t just leave things blank; if you hold back some vital piece of information too long, the reader will have already filled in that blank. It might feel smart to hold back the information that a character has only one arm, and to make it a shocking reveal in chapter ten, but the reader, oblivious to your cunning plan, will have automatically given them two arms in chapter one, and will resent not only having to lop an arm off the hero halfway through the book, but also having to go back mentally through the entire book, rewriting all the earlier scenes in their mind.
这适用于所有事情。记住，读者不能只是留白；如果你把一些重要的信息隐瞒太久，读者可能已经填补了那个空白。隐瞒一个角色只有一只手臂的信息，并在第十章中令人震惊地揭露，可能感觉很聪明，但读者不知道你的狡猾计划，会在第一章自动给他们两只手臂，他们不仅会讨厌在书中途砍掉英雄的一只手臂，而且还会在脑海中回顾整本书，在脑海中重写所有早期的场景。

That moment, where the reader realises they’ve imagined the fictional world wrong, and have to fix it, jolts the reader out of the story, and ends the dreamlike flow of images. Fine, if you want to do that. But don’t do it by mistake.
当读者意识到自己想象的虚构世界是错误的，必须纠正它时，读者就会被惊醒，脱离故事，结束如梦如幻的画面。如果你想这样做，那没问题。但不要误入歧途。

Such a glitch doesn’t just spoil that line, and damage the reading experience so far; it shakes their faith in your writing, which has implications for how they read the rest of your story. They will withdraw their consent a little; they won’t invest as deeply. They’ll hold back emotionally, and be on the alert for other mistakes. They won’t allow themselves to be as fully immersed in your world. They don’t want to get fooled again.
这样的小失误不仅会破坏那条线，损害迄今为止的阅读体验；它还会动摇读者对你写作的信心，这对他们阅读你故事的其余部分有影响。他们会稍微撤回他们的同意；他们不会投入太多。他们会在情​​感上有所保留，并对其他错误保持警惕。他们不会让自己完全沉浸在你的世界中。他们不想再被愚弄了。

 

THE SENTENCE IS NOT THE SMALLEST UNIT OF INFORMATION.
句子不是信息的最小单位。

Young writers, new writers, tend to think that, if all the information needed for a particular moment is packed inside a sentence, the job is done.
年轻作家、新作家往往认为，如果某一特定时刻所需的所有信息都包含在一个句子里，那么工作就完成了。

Not so.  并非如此。

Often a sentence, in an early draft, has the information in the wrong order for the reader. Beginners think of sentences as single units of meaning that happen all at once in a reader’s head. But sentences unfold, word by word, over time; and the information in them therefore arrives in a particular order. Make sure it is the right order. And if there is too much information for the sentence (often the case in a first draft, where you’re adding things as they occur to you), then break up the sentence. First draft sentences are often over-compressed; the writer has kept adding ideas to the sentences, and they don’t have room to breathe.
初稿中的句子信息顺序通常与读者理解的顺序错误。初学者认为句子是读者头脑中同时出现的单一意义单位。但句子会随着时间的推移逐字逐句地展开，因此其中的信息会以特定的顺序出现。确保顺序正确。如果句子信息量太大（初稿中经常出现这种情况，你会在想到什么就添加什么），那么就把句子拆开。初稿中的句子通常过于紧凑；作者一直在向句子中添加想法，句子没有喘息的空间。

 

A FIRST DRAFT SENTENCE  初稿

I’ll invent an example of what I’m talking about.
我将举一个例子来解释我所谈论的内容。

First draft, written as it occurred to the writer: Flip you, she said, spitting her gum into the gutter, having rolled down the windows of the BMW to shout at Harry, whom she had just seen standing outside the shop.
第一稿，作者如是写：翻你个身吧，她说着，把口香糖吐到了排水沟里，然后摇下宝马车的车窗对着哈利喊道，她刚刚看到哈利站在商店外面。

I have exaggerated slightly for comic effect (and toned down the swearing, so children can use this valuable guide), but sentences almost this banjaxed often turn up in early-stage fiction (and, indeed, still do in my own first drafts). You can see the writer thinking the scene into being on the page. (Which is fine! We all do this! That’s why we learn to edit!)
为了达到喜剧效果，我略微夸大了一点（并淡化了脏话，以便孩子们可以使用这本宝贵的指南），但几乎如此粗俗的句子经常出现在早期小说中（事实上，在我的初稿中仍然如此）。你可以看到作家在思考如何将场景写在纸上。（这很好！我们都这样做！这就是我们学习编辑的原因！）

Now read that, in slow motion, as a reader. See what happens? She swears, and spits gum, and now a window is being rolled down, oh wait that window would have made that gum spit impossible, fix that—swap the order around in your head, window then gum, OK, back to the story—oh she’s in a car, a BMW, go back again and visualise her in that as she spits, oh she was swearing at Harry, fine, go back AGAIN and aim her swear word at Harry, where is he though, oh he’s outside some kind of shop…
现在，以读者的身份，慢慢地阅读。看看会发生什么？她骂人，吐口香糖，现在窗户被摇了下来，哦，等等，那扇窗户会让她吐口香糖变得不可能，解决这个问题——在脑海中调换顺序，先是窗户，然后是口香糖，好的，回到故事中——哦，她在车里，一辆宝马，再回去想象她吐口水的时候，哦，她在骂哈利，好吧，再回去，把她的脏话对准哈利，但他在哪里，哦，他在某个商店外面……

Ugh. It’s impossible to see the scene unfold in your head. All the information you need is in the same sentence, sure, but it’s all in the wrong order, plus it’s over-compressed—it has no room to breathe. So the reader has no place to stop, if they needed a moment to see something clearly.
唉。你不可能在脑子里看到场景的展开。当然，你需要的所有信息都在同一个句子里，但顺序都错了，而且内容过于紧凑——没有喘息的空间。所以，如果读者需要一点时间来看清楚某件事，他们就没有地方停下来。

 

A SECOND DRAFT  第二稿

Now rearrange it, into the right order, and let it breathe:
现在将其重新排列成正确的顺序，然后让它呼吸：

Sally was driving home from work when she saw Harry standing outside the shop. She pulled in quietly beside him, and rolled down the window of the BMW. He didn’t see her. She spat her gum into the gutter, hard. Harry looked up. “Flip you,” she said.
莎莉下班开车回家时，看到哈利站在店外。她悄悄地把车停在他旁边，摇下宝马车的车窗。他没看见她。她狠狠地把口香糖吐到排水沟里。哈利抬起头。“翻你个身，”她说。

Now the information is in the right order; but is it enough information for the reader to construct a vivid scene in their head? Go back over it slowly. What can a reader, who isn’t you, build in their head from these specific words, in this specific order? What questions are they going to be asking? Can you answer them?
现在信息已经按正确的顺序排列了；但这些信息是否足以让读者在脑海中构建出生动的场景？慢慢回顾一下。读者（不是你）能从这些特定的词语、按照特定的顺序在脑海中构建出什么？他们会问什么问题？你能回答他们吗？

Well, what kind of shop is it? Why doesn’t Harry see her pull up? What’s Harry doing? Nobody just ‘stands’, waiting for the real character to turn up. Everybody in every scene must be real; must have a reason for doing what they are doing.
那么，这是什么商店？为什么哈利没看到她停下来？哈利在做什么？没有人只是“站着”，等待真正的角色出现。每个场景中的每个人都必须是真实的；必须有做他们所做事情的理由。

Do it again. Make it more specific, more vivid, easier to see in full, and therefore more believable. If you move from one character to another character, maybe put in a line-break, to help the reader see the jump. A useful trick is to imagine the words are directing a camera through the scene: zooming in, pulling back, cutting away. Do these words, in this order, show the reader everything they need, to build the scene in their head as it unfolds?
再来一次。让它更具体、更生动、更容易看清全貌，从而更可信。如果你从一个角色转移到另一个角色，也许可以换行，帮助读者看到跳跃。一个有用的技巧是想象这些文字引导着摄像机穿过场景：放大、拉回、切换。这些文字按此顺序是否向读者展示了他们需要的一切，以便在场景展开时在脑海中构建场景？

 

A THIRD DRAFT  第三稿

Sally was driving home from work when she saw Harry standing on the vomity pavement outside the kebab shop. His stubbled face almost touched his new iPhone, as he swiped.
莎莉下班开车回家时，看到哈利站在烤肉店外的人行道上。他那留着胡茬的脸几乎碰到了他的新 iPhone，因为他在刷手机。
She swung the BMW into the kerb, alongside him, and rolled down the window.
她将宝马车开到路边，与他并排停下，然后摇下了车窗。
Oblivious, he kept swiping; paused for a moment to study a topless Latvian from a distance of two inches; swiped.
他浑然不觉，继续刷​​着；停顿了一会儿，在两英寸的距离内仔细观察一名裸露上身的拉脱维亚人；又刷了下去。
Sally spat her gum into the gutter, hard.
莎莉把口香糖用力吐进了排水沟里。
Harry looked up.  哈利抬起头。
“Flip you,” she said.  “翻过身来，”她说。
The phone slipped from his fingers and landed, face down, in the bright orange vomit.
手机从他的手指间滑落，正面朝下，掉进了亮橙色的呕吐物中。

I’m not saying this is great literature; but it’s a lot easier to see in your head than the first version. What have we changed?
我并不是说这是一部伟大的文学作品；但与第一版相比，它更容易在脑海中显现。我们做了哪些改动？
The information arrives in the right order.
信息按照正确的顺序到达。
The sentences have room to breathe.
句子有足够的空间。
The action is vivid, and specific.
动作生动，具体。

 

IT’S NOT ABOUT YOU  这不是你的问题

This is the secret to editing your own work: understanding that it’s not about what’s in your head. In some ways, it’s not even about the words on the page. It’s about what those words are making happen in your reader’s head.
这是编辑自己作品的秘诀：了解编辑作品的关键不在于你脑子里在想什么。从某种程度上来说，编辑作品的关键甚至不在于纸上的文字。编辑作品的关键在于这些文字在读者脑子里产生了什么效果。

Once you’re able to read back your own words, and see, not the perfect thing you originally intended to say, but, instead, the actual experience those precise words will trigger inside a stranger’s head, then you have become a good editor of your own work.
一旦你能够回读自己的话，并发现，这不是你最初想要表达的完美的东西，而是这些精确的词语在陌生人的脑海中引发的实际体验，那么你就已经成为自己作品的优秀编辑了。

Just go over your work again and again, more times than you thought possible, making it a little clearer, a little better each time; and eventually you will have achieved a miracle. You will have mastered a form of telepathy, or magic, that no other species has ever achieved (and 99% of your own species still can’t do well).
只要反复检查你的工作，次数比你想象的要多，每次都让它更清晰、更好一点；最终你就会创造奇迹。你将掌握一种心灵感应或魔法，这是其他物种从未实现过的（而你自己物种的 99% 仍然做不到）。

You will have a superpower. You will be able to make your visions appear in someone else’s head…
你将拥有超能力。你将能够让你的想象出现在别人的脑海中……

Good luck.  祝你好运。

 

I COULD WRITE A BOOK
我可以写一本书

I could happily write a book on editing, but I’ve run out of time, and space. But, here are a couple more important notes.
我很乐意写一本关于编辑的书，但我没有时间和空间了。不过，这里还有几点重要说明。

(UNIMPORTANT NOTE: Ten drafts and two months later, those important notes are now longer than the article. I could take the line out, but I’ve left it as a reminder that editing is often an exhausting, messy business.)
（不重要的说明：经过十稿和两个月的努力，那些重要的说明现在已经比文章本身还长了。我可以删掉这行字，但我还是把它留下来提醒大家，编辑通常是一件令人筋疲力尽、混乱的工作。）

 

1. DON’T FIX COMMAS WHEN THE PLOT IS BROKEN
1. 当情节不连贯时不要修改逗号

When you are editing, fix the story at the most fundamental level at which it is broken. If the plot doesn’t work, don’t faff about with the commas. If you’ve told the whole thing from the wrong character’s point of view, fix that before you worry about the accuracy of the Jamaican slang in the dialogue.
编辑时，从最根本的地方修复故事。如果情节不合理，不要在逗号上浪费时间。如果你从错误的角色角度讲述了整个故事，那么在担心对话中牙买加俚语的准确性之前，先修复它。

If you are building a house and it still needs a roof and floorboards, it is a complete waste of time to do the dusting.
如果您正在建造房屋并且仍需要屋顶和地板，那么除尘就完全是浪费时间。

 

2. GET CLOSER  2. 靠近一点

And in general, get closer; closer to the characters, closer to their actions and thoughts and feelings.
总的来说，就是更加接近人物，更加接近他们的行为、思想和感受。

Often we think we have written a scene when, in fact, we have merely written a description of the scene; a blueprint for the scene we need to write.
我们常常以为自己已经写好了一个场景，但事实上，我们只是写了场景的描述；写了我们需要写的场景的蓝图。

Often we’ve got a main character who is too far back from the action. A totally passive main character—acted on, but not acting—is a real giveaway. Literary writers in particular have a habit of creating a main character who observes the story unfolding, without actually taking part in the story. That is, their hero is essentially the writer, but inside the story; adding nothing to it, and usually stinking the place up with their opinions.
我们经常会遇到一个远离故事情节的主角。一个完全被动的主角——被人操控，但没有表演——是真正的泄密者。文学作家尤其习惯于创造一个观察故事发展，但实际上并不参与故事的主角。也就是说，他们的英雄本质上是作家，但在故事中；没有给故事增添任何内容，而且通常会用他们的观点来破坏故事。

A lot of literary fiction does this; personally I think this is a lousy way to write a book. (If Jesus resurfaced in modern day Brooklyn, the Gospels of Matthew, Marsha, Lukas and Joan would tell you an awful lot about Matthew, Marsha, Lukas and Joan and how they felt about stuff, but not a lot about Jesus.)
很多文学小说都是这样做的；我个人认为这是写书的糟糕方式。（如果耶稣在现代的布鲁克林重新出现，马太福音、玛莎福音、卢卡斯福音和琼福音会告诉你很多关于马太福音、玛莎福音、卢卡斯福音和琼福音以及他们对事物的感受，但关于耶稣的则不多。）

Find the character who ends up changed the most by the plot. That’s the main character. Kill off the writer character who watches their rise and fall.
找到最终因剧情而改变最大的角色。那就是主角。杀死目睹他们兴衰的作家角色。

Get one step closer: just tell the interesting character’s story.
更进一步：只需讲述有趣角色的故事。

 

3. NO ORNAMENTAL FERNS  3. 禁止种植观赏蕨类植物

In real life, people want stuff, and do stuff. But in fiction, characters will sometimes just hang around, like raincoats on clothes hangers, until the writer needs them to do something. They haven’t been fully imagined.
在现实生活中，人们想要东西，然后做事情。但在小说中，人物有时只是闲逛，就像衣架上的雨衣一样，直到作家需要他们做某事。他们还没有被完全想象出来。

At WonderCon, in 2014, comic book writer and editor Kelly Sue DeConnick came up with The Sexy Lamp Test. In its original form (and close your eyes, children! I can’t clean this up, because it’s a direct quote, and also a great quote): ‘If you can take a female character out, and replace them with a sexy lamp, and your plot still functions, then fuck you.’
2014 年，在 WonderCon 上，漫画作家兼编辑凯莉·苏·德科尼克 (Kelly Sue DeConnick) 提出了“性感灯测试” 。其原始版本（孩子们，闭上你们的眼睛！我无法改正，因为这是一句直接引用的话，而且是一句很棒的名言）是：“如果你能把一个女性角色拿走，用一盏性感灯代替，而你的情节仍然有效，那你就去死吧。”

A very useful and necessary test. But I’ve seen so many writers (male and female) have this problem with their major characters (male and female)—often their lead characters!—that I feel a more universal version is also worth stating: ‘If you can take any major character out, and replace them with an ornamental fern, and your plot still functions; then you need to imagine that character more deeply, and rewrite their scenes so that the plot puts pressure on them to make choices that have consequences.’
这是一个非常有用和必要的测试。但我见过很多作家（男性和女性）在写主要角色（男性和女性）时都遇到了这个问题——通常是主角！——所以我觉得还有一个更普遍的版本值得一提：“如果你可以把任何主要角色拿走，用观赏蕨类植物代替，而你的情节仍然有效；那么你需要更深入地想象这个角色，重写他们的场景，让情节给他们施加压力，让他们做出有后果的选择。”

(That, by the way, is the secret of good storytelling, thrown away casually in those last few words: put pressure on your characters so they are forced to make choices that have consequences. Too big a subject for an aside, it deserves its own article. Meanwhile, if you want to tell stories—as opposed to write clever sentences—then study that line like a zen koan. Everything is hidden in there.)
（顺便说一句，这是讲好故事的秘诀，在最后几个字中随口说出：给你的角色施加压力，迫使他们做出会产生后果的选择。这个话题太大了，不适合放在一边，值得写一篇文章。同时，如果你想讲故事——而不是写出巧妙的句子——那么就像研究禅宗公案一样研究那句话。一切都隐藏在那里。）

 

4. KEEP GOING  4. 继续前进

It’s normal to be sick of your story before it is finished. You just have to keep going, and get it right.
在故事结束前感到厌倦是正常的。你只需要继续写下去，并把它做好。

Towards the end, it’s not about you, it’s about the reader. The people that build airplanes probably get bored before they are finished, too, but that doesn’t mean they deliver planes to the customer with bits missing and the wings on upside down.
到最后，它不再关乎你，而是关乎读者。制造飞机的人可能在完成之前也会感到无聊，但这并不意味着他们会把零件缺失、机翼倒置的飞机交付给客户。

Love your story, want the best for it, even if it can be ungrateful and exasperating and difficult, and you think it’s never going to grow up and leave home.
爱你的故事，希望它得到最好的结果，即使它可能令人厌烦、令人恼火、难以接受，而且你认为它永远不会长大、离开家。

The difference between an unpublishable and a publishable story is often simply that the writer of the publishable story kept going, kept on editing, fixing the big things first, then the little things, until they finally got it right; got down what was in their head in a form that could be decoded by strangers hungry for stories; for connection; for love.
不可出版的故事与可出版的故事之间的区别通常仅仅在于，可出版故事的作者会继续努力，继续编辑，先修改大的地方，然后再修改小的地方，直到最终得到正确的结果；将他们脑中的想法以一种能够被渴望故事、联系和爱的陌生人解读的形式记录下来。

But don’t use this as an excuse to spend your whole life polishing one story. If you’ve worked it, and reworked it, and reworked it, and still nobody likes it, well, maybe it’s just a private story that you needed to write (to develop, to grow), but nobody needs to read. No big deal. It happens. Move on. I have faith in your ability to come up with more, and better, work.
但不要以此为借口，花一生的时间来润色一个故事。如果你已经写过、修改过、再修改过，但仍然没有人喜欢它，那么，也许这只是一个你需要写的私人故事（为了发展、成长），但没有人需要阅读。没什么大不了的。这是常有的事。继续前进。我相信你有能力创作出更多更好的作品。

Trust me, I know what I’m talking about here. From age 11, I started and abandoned many novels before I finally finished my first. And my first was OK, but it wasn’t good enough to get published. 
相信我，我知道我在说什么。从 11 岁起，我开始写又放弃了许多小说，直到我终于完成了我的第一部小说。我的第一部小说还不错，但还不足以出版。

 

5. STOP WORRYING ABOUT YOUR FIRST DRAFTS
5. 别再为初稿担忧

But what does all this mean?
但这一切意味着什么？

It means the quality of your first draft has absolutely no bearing on the quality of the finished work, so you can stop worrying about it.
这意味着您的初稿的质量与最终作品的质量完全没有关系，因此您不必担心。

Some fine writers write accomplished first drafts, that are almost publishable. And some fine writers write first drafts that a profoundly average primary school student would hesitate to hand in as homework. And… it doesn’t matter. This ‘failure’ is normal, it’s not actually failure any more than a pile of iron ore is a failed steel ingot. The first draft, like the ore, just hasn’t been processed yet.
有些优秀作家写出了完美的初稿，几乎可以出版。而有些优秀作家写的初稿，连一个普通的小学生都不愿意交作为家庭作业。而且……这没关系。这种“失败”很正常，它实际上并不是失败，就像一堆铁矿石不是一块失败的钢锭一样。初稿就像矿石一样，只是还没有被加工。

 

6. MY OWN FIRST DRAFTS ARE SHITE
6. 我的第一稿很糟糕

With fiction, I write an average of 18 drafts and the first one is always lousy. (Occasionally something will come together quickly and I’ll only write a dozen drafts. Some things take 25 drafts.) My early re-draftings are often quite violent: I’ll rip the story apart and start again, I’ll cut out half of it, I’ll change the tense, the point of view, the location. By the last few drafts, I’m just going through an almost finished piece, pretty casually, moving commas, and cutting the odd adjective.
对于小说，我平均要写 18 稿，而第一稿总是很糟糕。（偶尔有些东西会很快成型，我只需要写十几稿。有些东西需要 25 稿。）我早期的重写通常相当激烈：我会把故事拆开再重新开始，我会删掉一半，我会改变时态、观点和地点。在最后几稿中，我只是在相当随意地翻阅一部几乎完成的作品，移动逗号，删掉奇怪的形容词。

My own first drafts, by the way, have gotten worse over the years, rather than better, as I’ve grown more confident in my rewriting and in my editing of myself. I now know I can make the roughest material better with a lot of drafts and a lot of work; I just need something to work on. So I write first drafts that are full of typos and holes. And when I say holes, I mean actual gaps, where I might note ‘fix this problem later’ or ‘blah blah blah’ for a conversation that I don’t feel like imagining yet. Also, I usually start writing now with no idea what anyone is called, so I just type ‘&&&&&&’ where the names should be. (I’m writing these characters into existence – it’s easier to name them later when I know who they are.) Or I’ll simply write long dialogue scenes in an unbroken flow, with no quote marks, no paragraph breaks, and no attribution to anybody. I know who’s speaking, and I’ll tidy all that up later; what’s important to keep up the flow, to get the gist of it down without standing in my own way.
顺便说一句，随着我对重写和自我编辑越来越有信心，我自己的初稿多年来变得越来越糟，而不是越来越好。我现在知道，通过大量的草稿和大量的工作，我可以让最粗糙的材料变得更好；我只是需要一些可以改进的东西。所以我写的初稿充满了错别字和漏洞。当我说漏洞时，我指的是真正的空白，我可能会在其中标注“稍后修复此问题”或“等等等等”，以表示我还不想想象的对话。此外，我现在通常开始写作时不知道任何人叫什么，所以我只是在应该有名字的地方输入“&&&&&&”。（我正在将这些角色写成存在——当我知道他们是谁时，以后给他们命名会更容易。）或者我会简单地以不间断的流程写出长对话场景，没有引号，没有段落中断，也没有任何人的归属。我知道谁在讲话，稍后我会把一切都整理好；重要的是保持流程，把要点记下来，而不会妨碍我自己。

On the first draft, I’m the story’s mother, I just want it to come into the world safely, covered in blood and goo. Whatever it looks like, as long as it’s breathing, I’ll love it just the way it is.
在初稿中，我是故事的母亲，我只希望它能安全地来到这个世界，浑身沾满鲜血和黏液。无论它长什么样，只要它还在呼吸，我就会爱它本来的样子。

On the second and third drafts, I’m more like a stern foster parent to a troubled child. It needs discipline and hard work. I’m affectionate, but I have some emotional distance. I’m going to do what it takes to help this kid kick its adverb problem, find a better point of view, and get its life back on the rails.
在第二稿和第三稿中，我更像是一个严厉的养父母，照顾一个问题孩子。他需要管教和努力。我很亲切，但我在情感上有些距离。我会尽我所能帮助这个孩子解决副词问题，找到更好的观点，让他的生活重回正轨。

On later drafts, I’m the police and I’m interrogating a repeat offender and not letting it get away with anything. (The three words I write most often in the margins of my own work are ‘Fix!’ ‘Boring!‘ and ‘SHITE.’ I write these words cheerfully, in red pen, as I strike out whole pages, because I know I’m making the story better.)
在后来的草稿中，我扮演警察，审问惯犯，不让其逃脱任何惩罚。（我在自己作品的空白处最常写的三个词是“修复！”“无聊！”和“糟糕”。我用红笔兴高采烈地写下这些词，同时划掉整页，因为我知道我让故事变得更好了。）

 

7. DESPAIR IN YOUR HAIR
7. 头发里的绝望

Oh yeah, two thirds the way through a project there is, almost always, a moment of despair, where you are convinced it will never come together.
噢，是的，当一个项目进行到三分之二的时候，几乎总是会出现一个绝望的时刻，你确信它永远不会成功。

Despair, but don’t worry. You are, after all, a hero on a journey. This is a perfectly normal Dark Night of the Soul. Have a little cry, and carry on.
绝望，但别担心。毕竟，你是旅途中的英雄。这是灵魂的正常黑夜。哭一会儿，继续前行。

Triumph lies over the next hill.
胜利就在下一座山上。

OK, maybe the hill after that…
好的，也许之后是山……

 

8. YOU’RE NOT A FREAK
8. 你不是怪胎

It’s normal to be slightly freaked out by your own work.
对自己的工作感到有点害怕是正常的。
It’s normal for the middle to stay a bit of a mess for a surprisingly long time.
中间出现混乱的情况持续很长时间是正常的。
It’s normal to not quite know how it ends until INCREDIBLY late in the process.
直到过程非常后期才知道结果如何，这很正常。

 

9. A FINAL NOTE  9. 最后说明

These aren’t rules, they’re techniques, to use or not use, as you choose. I’ve written these ones down, because I know, from personal experience, that they work. But there are other ways of working.
这些不是规则，而是技巧，你可以选择使用或不使用。我把这些写下来，因为我从个人经验中知道它们是有效的。但还有其他方法。

And there are exceptions to everything I have said here. Some writers really are just writing for themselves, yet it can still be fun to listen in. If Beckett had taken my advice here, he’d have totally, er, flipped himself up.
我在这里所说的一切都有例外。有些作家真的只是为自己写作，但听他们说话还是很有趣的。如果贝克特听从了我的建议，他就会完全改变自己。

Everything I have said you shouldn’t do here? There are tricksy flippers who have found some brilliant way to do it. Some of my favourite writers totally ignore these techniques.
我说过你不应该在这里做的一切？有些狡猾的翻转者找到了一些绝妙的方法。我最喜欢的一些作家完全忽略了这些技巧。

Use what’s useful to you, dump what’s not.
使用对你有用的东西，丢弃没用的东西。

 

TL;DR  总结

So, here’s how to write something good, from beginning to end:
因此，下面是从头到尾写出好文章的方法：

Bang down a first draft. Don’t worry about it being any good, it won’t be. Don’t try to edit it on the way out of your head. That requires a different part of your brain, and the whole process will stall. Just jam open the firedoor between your conscious and unconscious mind, and let it all out, uncensored and unspellchecked. Let rip, have fun, you can clean it up later.
完成初稿。不要担心它是否好，它不会好。不要试图在脑海中编辑它。这需要你大脑的不同部分，整个过程会停滞。只需打开意识和潜意识之间的防火门，让一切不加审查、不加拼写检查地流露出来。尽情享受吧，你可以稍后再清理。

Leave it aside to cool. (Days, week, months—whatever it takes.)
将其放在一边冷却。（几天、一周、几个月——无论需要多长时间。）

Then read it like a reader, and edit it into shape over as many drafts as it takes, which could be a LOT of drafts. It can be useful to do specific drafts for specific problems: a plot draft; a dialogue draft; a draft to fix a major character who needs a lot of work…
然后像读者一样阅读，并尽可能多地修改，这可能会是很多稿。针对特定问题进行特定修改会很有用：情节稿；对话稿；修复需要大量工作的主要角色的稿……

No one draft will fix everything. Take the pressure off yourself.
没有一份草案可以解决所有问题。减轻自己的压力。

 

10. ALL WRITING ADVICE MUST END, ON A CAUTIOUSLY UPLIFTING NOTE, WITH A FLOWERY METAPHOR
10. 所有写作建议都必须以谨慎而令人振奋的语气和一个华丽的隐喻作为结尾

Hey, see the Mountain of Success, way over there? The only way to get to it is through the Valley of Failure. There is no other way.
嘿，看到那边的成功之山了吗？到达那里的唯一途径就是穿过失败之谷。没有别的办法。

It’s a peculiarity of this job that it’s the reader who gets to sit on that mountain, in the sunshine, reading a perfect, finished piece. The writer at no point has that experience. The writer is, always, down in the valley, struggling with imperfect draft after imperfect draft. (That’s not a bad thing; that’s just a thing… Personally, I love that struggle, I find it fascinating, and deeply fulfilling. My relationship with failure is by now very friendly and relaxed.)
这份工作的一个特点是，读者可以坐在山上，沐浴着阳光，阅读一篇完美、完成的作品。作家却从来没有这种体验。作家总是在山谷下，挣扎着写出一篇又一篇不完美的草稿。（这不是坏事，只是一件事情……就我个人而言，我喜欢这种挣扎，我觉得它很迷人，而且非常充实。我现在与失败的关系非常友好和轻松。）

And it never ends. With every story and every book, you must re-enter the valley of failure, and set off, again, for the distant mountain.
而它永远不会结束。每读完一个故事、每读完一本书，你都必须重新进入失败之谷，然后再次出发，奔向遥远的山峰。

But, on every journey, with every story, every book, if the writer can make each draft a little better than the last, can stagger a few yards further along the rocky valley floor, the job will, eventually, get done. The journey will, eventually, end. You will fail your way to success.
但是，在每一次旅程、每一个故事、每一本书中，如果作家能够让每一稿都比上一稿好一点，能够沿着岩石谷底再向前迈几步，那么最终任务就会完成。旅程最终会结束。在通往成功的道路上，你会遭遇失败。

And, one day, a reader will sit in the sunshine, and have a vision; a vivid, detailed vision that you have transmitted from your mind to theirs. And that moment, that magic, that miracle – that’s worth a lot of hard work.
有一天，读者会坐在阳光下，心中浮现出一个愿景；一个生动、详细的愿景，你已将其从你的脑海中传递到他们的脑海中。那一刻、那种魔力、那种奇迹——值得付出很多努力。

OK, off you go.  好的，你走吧。
The valley awaits you.  山谷正等待着你。
